# Zombieland-SAMP
An improved and SQLite version of the Zombieland script (where I was a developer back then).

## Credits
All the past developers who contributed to the project!

## How do I use it?
### Requirements:
1. Basic SQL/SQLite knowledge
2. A directory/ folder in scriptfiles directory called "ZL"

Well, download the Original Zombieland script and take their filterscript maps and put them on your server's filterscript folder. Since I'm not allowed to redistribute them, you'll need to do it yourself.

Afterwards, you may download the script from here and run the server for first time. It'll shutdown as no maps are present in the database.

Then, the server will create the database since it's being ran for the first time, then you may open the database using SQLite database manager or some similar software.

Then, you may upload the .CSV file I've provided that includes all the map data (such as spawns etc)

## Bugs?
I've not properly tested the script and there may be bugs present in it - However, don't worry! I'll provide support for it.

## Contributions?
Feel free to contribute to the project and make your remarks, but most importantly, if you fix something, you may pull a request here and I'll merge it.

## Thanks for reading!!
